# Group1_Rotation3
This repository consists of the code used to complete Rotation 3 of the Bioinformatics Group Project module. Used by both Franklin Brown and Jade Gregory.

## Overview
Studies on both ‘pure’ lyrata and arenosa have already been undergone. Instead, the purpose of this project was to look into various lyrata/arenosa hybrids. To conclude, we wanted to look into the divirsity of the hybrids - and whether they are more diverse than their pure couterparts.

## Objectives
The first aim of this project was to sense-check the dataset. This was done by utilising three separate methods of analysis: fastSTRUCTURE, PCA, and SplitsTree. The second aim was to determine an ideal cohort by looking at the allele frequency spectra of the data provided, and to decide whether hybrid-types have a higher rate of diversity than their ‘pure’ counterparts.

## Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of this project was

Dependencies required to run the code in this repository are noted in the file '[Dependencies]()'. Code credits are provided in the file labelled '[Bibliography]()'.

The scripts in this Repository are to be run in the following order:
1) [fastSTRUCTURE_prep.py]() which utilises both the 'structure.py' and the
2) [PCA.R](PCA.R) which allows for both eigen analysis as well as a PCA scatter graph to be produced
4) [SplitsTree.py]() which will produce a tree
