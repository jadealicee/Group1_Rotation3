# Group1_Rotation3
This repository consists of the code used to complete Rotation 3 of the Bioinformatics Group Project module. Used by both Franklin Brown and Jade Gregory.

Studies on both ‘pure’ lyrata and arenosa have already been undergone. Instead, the purpose of this project was to look into various lyrata/arenosa hybrids. To conclude, we wanted to look into the divirsity of the hybrids - and whether they are more diverse than their pure couterparts.

The first aim of this project was to sense-check the dataset. This was done by utilising three separate methods of analysis: fastSTRUCTURE, PCA, and SplitsTree. The second aim was to determine an ideal cohort by looking at the allele frequency spectra of the data provided, and to decide whether hybrid-types have a higher rate of diversity than their ‘pure’ counterparts.

The expected outcome of this project was

Dependencies required to run the code in this repository will be noted in the file 'Dependencies'. Code credits will be provided in the file labelled 'Bibliography'.

The scripts in this Repository are to be run in the following order:
-fastSTRUCTURE_prep.py (which utilises both the 'structure.py' and the
-PCA.r which allows for both eigen analysis as well as a PCA scatter graph to be produced
-SplitsTree which will produce a tree
