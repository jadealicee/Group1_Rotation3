# Group1_Rotation3
This repository consists of the code used to complete Rotation 3 of the Bioinformatics Group Project module. Used by both Franklin Brown and Jade Gregory.

This project consisted of sense-checking the data by producing all three of the following: a PCA, fastSTRUCTURE analysis, and a SplitsTree. After this, results were analysed to try and find a cohort of interest by assessing the allele spectra frequency. 

To conclude, we wanted to look into the divirsity of the hybrids - and whether they are more diverse than their pure couterparts.

Code credits will be provided in the file labelled 'Bibliography'.
